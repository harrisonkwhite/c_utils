# C Utils

This library contains utilities that I use on a regular basis across many C projects, such as memory arenas and macros for generating array types.

## Building

Building and running this project has been tested on Linux and Windows.

Clone the repository by running `git clone https://github.com/harrisonkwhite/c_utils.git`.

Then go into the repository root and build with CMake:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

You can also use the "build.sh" shell script if on a platform which supports it.
